To be able to use weka it was necessary to add two jars to our Java version.
The first jar is a mysql jar called: mysql-connector-java-3.1.8-bin.jar
The second one is the actual weka jar:  weka.jar  
----
Now, you need to put this jars in this folder:
~/library/Java/Extensions
----
And finally run this in your terminal(I am using bash, so it really depends in what you have):
	bash export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/johndoe/jars/mysql-connector-java-3.1.8-bin.jar

IF you have a C Shell terminal you should run:
	c shell setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH:/home/johndoe/jars/mysql-connector-java-3.1.8-bin.jar
